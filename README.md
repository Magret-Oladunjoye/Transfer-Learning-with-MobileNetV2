# Transfer-Learning-with-MobileNetV2


As part of an exercise for the 3rd course in the Deep Learning Specialization offered by Stanford online and deeplearning.ai, I implemented transfer learning on a pre-trained CNN to build an Alpaca/Not Alpaca classifier

MobileNetV2, was designed to provide fast and computationally efficient performance. It's been pre-trained on ImageNet, a dataset containing over 14 million images and 1000 classes.
