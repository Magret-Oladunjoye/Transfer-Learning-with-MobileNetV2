# Transfer-Learning-with-MobileNetV2


As part of an exercise for the 4th course in the Deep Learning Specialization offered by Stanford online and deeplearning.ai, I implemented transfer learning on a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to build an Alpaca/Not Alpaca classifier

The CNN, MobileNetV2, was designed to provide fast and computationally efficient performance. It's been pre-trained on ImageNet, a dataset containing over 14 million images and 1000 classes.
